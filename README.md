## 🎪 Fun Facts About My Code
- My APIs are RESTful, but I am not
- I write more documentation comments than actual code (just kidding, who has time for docs?)
- My error messages are more creative than my variable names
- I believe in microservices... the smaller, the better (easier to blame someone else)

*"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand... I'm still working on that part."* - Probably not Martin Fowler, but definitely me at 3 AM
