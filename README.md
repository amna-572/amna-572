# Hi there! 👋 I'm Amna - Your Friendly Neighborhood Backend Wizard 🧙‍♀️

## 🎭 About Me
- 🔧 **Professional Server Whisperer** - I speak fluent API and database
- 🐛 **Bug Bounty Hunter** - I don't find bugs, they find me (and we become best friends)

- 🌙 **Night Owl Programmer** - Because production servers only break at 3 AM
- 🔥 **Backend Enthusiast** - Frontend? Never heard of her.
- 💭 **Philosophy:** Why waste time explaining things to people when you can just write code and build APIs? Less talking, more coding! 🚀

## 🎪 Fun Facts About My Code
- My APIs are RESTful, but I am not
- I write more documentation comments than actual code (just kidding, who has time for docs?)
- My error messages are more creative than my variable names
- I believe in microservices... the smaller, the better (easier to blame someone else)

### 💡 Pro Tip
If my repositories seem quiet, I'm probably:
- Fighting with a database 🗡️
- Reading documentation 📚
- Questioning my life choices 🤔
- Actually fixing bugs (rare but it happens) ✨

**Remember:** There are only 2 hard problems in computer science:
1. Cache invalidation
2. Naming things  
3. Off-by-one errors

*"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand... I'm still working on that part."* - Probably not Martin Fowler, but definitely me at 3 AM
